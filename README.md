# Blender-Pixel-3D-Converter

!!!

This is currently essentially Lucas' code copy pasted here in github. I've made this project open to allow the code to be more easily seen and shared with co-pilot as I work on it. Posted here for discussion and archieve purposes.

Addon for converting 3D images to pixel art! Based on the wonderful addon made by Lucas Roedel, which in turn was inspired by Mezka.

QA: Why does this project exist when another free option exists?

Open source! As well as allow me to bug fix a few issues I see with Lucas' model specificly targeting some pixel art fundementales like 'jaggies' (inconsistent pixel allocation) and more generally outline generatation, a limitation pointed out by Lucas themselves. Plus some tech practice for myself ^-^
